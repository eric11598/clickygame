# ClickyGame

Columbia bootcamp React homework. Components separately built to run the game, navbar, character cards, and title. The game will give you a point if you click on a character you have not clicked before. If you click the same character, however, the game will end and put your score to 0. The order of the characters wil randomize after every click. High scores are saved!
